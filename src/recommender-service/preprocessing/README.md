# Step 1
To seperate node and way file you can run the script as

$ .\separate_node_way_file.py ../map/munich_small

where munich_small.osm is your osm XML file. Note that the argument passed is relative address of the file.

The script will create a .nodes and .ways file with same filename (e.g. munich_small.nodes and munich_small.ways) in the same directory where .osm file is present.
